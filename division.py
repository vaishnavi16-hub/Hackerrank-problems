# Task:-
# The provided code stub reads two integers,  and , from STDIN.

# Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division,  // . The second line should contain the result of float division,  / .

# No rounding or formatting is necessary.

# Example


# The result of the integer division .
# The result of the float division is .

# Solution:
# if __name__  == '__main__':
#     a = int(input())
#     b = int(input())

#     #integer division
#      print(a//b)
    
#     #  Float division
#     print(a/b)

#     output:-   0
#               0.6
