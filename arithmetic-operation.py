# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,  and . Add code to print three lines where:

# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
# Example


# Print the following:

# 8
# -2
# 15



# solution:- 

# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     a = int(input())
#     b = int(input())

#     # for sum
#     print (a+b)

#     # for Difference
#     print(a-b)

#     # Product
#     print(a*b)

#     output:- 

#     8
#     -2
#     15
